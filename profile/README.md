## Hi there 👋

Hardware is an integral component to a "self-driving" (i.e., autonomous) scientific laboratory. There are several approaches to hardware solutions for self-driving labs (SDLs). For example, do you choose something proprietary or open-source? Commercially bought or home-built? When designing systems, when do you use human-inspired vs. hardware-centric design principles? Do you go for something integrated and robust or modular and reconfigurable? In this in-person hackathon, we will come up with solutions and ideas to the challenges associated with designing and building self-driving lab hardware for accelerated scientific discovery in the physical sciences. The hackathon is scheduled on Friday, August 9, 2024 in Vancouver, BC during the [Accelerate 2024 conference](https://www.accelerate24.ca/). Team projects will be judged and projects awarded, with a scholarly article to follow. Join us to explore, collaborate, innovate, and contribute to the advancement of scientific hardware for self-driving labs!
